            <h2>An impossible dream takes shape</h2>
            <p>After the Chip Player and Click disappointments, and amidst the
                general boredom of running his import/export company, Christian
                decided that instead of chasing after the perfect business idea, he
                would follow his heart. He would build his dream car.
                
                Christian understood that it was virtually impossible and that many had
                failed before him. But to him, it was a mission: to create the perfect car
                with no compromises, no limits, and no fear of failure.
                
                It was against this backdrop that a young Christian von Koenigsegg
                followed a dream and launched his own car company in 1994.

            <h2>why we get out of bed in the morning</h2>
            <h3>the beginning of it all</h3>
            <p>Each and every Koenigsegg has a premium price, but then each and
                every Koenigsegg has been painstakingly built by a select group of
                automotive artisans to the highest possible standards.
                
                At Koenigsegg, we are able to fabricate intricate, hand-made metal
                and carbon fiber components in our own hi-tech production facilities.
                We also source specialist components from a network of dedicated
                suppliers and partners – most of which are based in Sweden.

            <h2>innovating the future in-house</h2>
            <h3>all from scratch</h3>
            <h4>a quarter century if invention</h4>
            <p>Christian and Koenigsegg Automotive AB have introduced and
                patented multiple new technologies over the years. Among them are
                the ”rocket” catalytic converter, the supercharger response system and
                a variable geometry turbo system, to name but a few. We've even
                developed unique ways of using carbon fiber that make the car lighter,
                stronger and safer.
                
                The Koenigsegg philosophy does not tolerate compromise. Rather, we
                work with innovation in order to avoid compromise completely. Nothing
                is impossible. This open-mindedness and dedication are what define
                Koenigsegg and its cars.

            <h2>the home of koenigsegg</h2>
            <h3>angelholm - sweden</h3>
            <p>Koenigsegg moved to its present location in Ängelholm, Sweden, in
                2003. The building had previously been home to the Swedish Air Force
                and once housed JAS 39 Gripen fighter jets.
                
                Now refurbished to suit Koenigsegg’s requirements, these facilities
                provide the perfect infrastructure for building high-tech Hypercars.
                There is ample room for the composite workshop, engine development
                and testing, pre- and final assembly, paint shop, research and
                development facilities, as well as vehicle and parts storage.
                
                It is here, in this state-of-the-art facility in southern Sweden, that
                Koenigsegg creates a handful of bespoke Hypercars every year.

            <h2>spirit of performance</h2>
            <h3>the ghost symbol</h3>
            <p>You may have seen the ghost that adorns the rear hood over the
                engine bay of every Koenigsegg, or you may have seen it on our
                clothing and jewelry.
                
                But why a ghost?
                
                The reason for this is that Koenigsegg's facility in
                Ängelholm was previously an air force base, and home to one of
                Sweden’s most legendary air force squadrons – Johan Röd – the
                Ghost Squadron. The squadron would take off early in the morning
                and fly until dusk. People heard the planes flying above the clouds but
                could never quite see them, earning them their ‘Ghost Squadron’
                moniker.
                
                Koenigsegg inherited the Ghost Squadron’s hangars and runway in the
                early 2000s. The pilots and crew were sad to leave, but happy that a
                worthy operation took over their fabled site. They offered Koenigsegg
                their coveted ghost, and asked us to honor the squadron by placing it
                on each car built at their old facility, just as it appeared on their fighter
                jets. As time has passed, Koenigsegg drivers, as well as fans, have
                come to feel very much a part of the Ghost Squadron itself. The Ghost
                Squadron symbol has never shone brighter, and it is now known
                around the world as the Spirit of Performance.
